=== SETUP ===
# univention-install univention-letsencrypt
# ucr set letsencrypt/services/apache2=yes   # only if service is installed and certificate is required!
# ucr set letsencrypt/services/postfix=yes   # only if service is installed and certificate is required!
# ucr set letsencrypt/services/dovecot=yes   # only if service is installed and certificate is required!
# ucr set letsencrypt/domains="www.somedomain.com www.anotherdomain.org"   # only, if $hostname.$domainname does not fit
# /usr/share/univention-letsencrypt/setup-letsencrypt

UCR variable "letsencrypt/domains" can also be changed after installation (e.g. for adding additional domains).
After changing "letsencrypt/domains", call the script /usr/share/univention-letsencrypt/setup-letsencrypt.
When asked for recreation of domain.csr by the script, answer with "y".

Via cron job, the certificate is refreshed on each first day of month on 3:30 AM.

Currently only 3 services are preconfigured and have to be explicitly enabled:
apache, postfix, dovecot

Additional services can be added via scripts in
/etc/univention/letsencrypt/setup.d/ and
/etc/univention/letsencrypt/post-refresh.d/
